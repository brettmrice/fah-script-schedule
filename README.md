# FAH Active Schedule

## Windows batch script to schedule when FAH is active

24 hours of running keeps the room warm. I wanted FAH to only run during the day when I do not mind the higher flucation in room temp. This script allows me to set active hours for FAH. The script starts folding in the morning at 0600 and then sends a finish command at 1900 - making FAH inactive between ~1900 and 0600.
